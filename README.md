# Image warping application

## Warping Operations:
1. Blur
2. Swirl
3. Bulge
4. Fisheye

**Some operations are written in RenderScript for performance reasons within the Android environment.**

# From Google's documentation
RenderScript is a framework for running computationally intensive tasks at high performance on Android. RenderScript is primarily oriented for use with data-parallel computation, although serial workloads can benefit as well. The RenderScript runtime parallelizes work across processors available on a device, such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs
